#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
O(n)
It is in a linear time and will grow in that fashion with n
b)O(n log n) 
The for loop will run n times (because of the range). Then the while loop j is increasing every time it goes through. They then get multiplied together since they are nested loops which leads to O(n log n)
c)O(n)
A recursion problem, and goes up in a linear fashion with n.

## Exercise II
Figure out what floor is the middle one of the building and drop an egg from there, if the doesn't break then go to the middle of the floors above that one and see if the egg breaks. Or if the egg breaks in the middle floor of the entire building then go to the middle of the lower floors and see if the egg breaks and keep going to the middle of what is now your base floors until you find what the actual f/base is. 
O(log n) each time you are cutting the floor number in half.
